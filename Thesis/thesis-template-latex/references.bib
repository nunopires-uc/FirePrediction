Thus, predicting such an environmental issue becomes a critical concern to mitigate this threat. Several technologies and new methods have been proposed to predict and detect forest fires. The trend is toward the integration of artificial intelligence to automate the prediction and detection of fire occurrence. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the machine learning algorithms based forest fires prediction and detection systems. First, a brief introduction to the forest fire concern is given. Then, various methods and systems in forest fires prediction and detection systems are reviewed. Besides works that reported fire prediction and detection systems, studies that assessed the factors influencing the fire occurrence and risk are discussed. The main issues and outcomes within each study are presented and discussed.}

However, forest fires are caused by many factors, which cannot be explained only by geographical and meteorological reasons.

This article aims to prepare a fire risk zone map by using a data set consisting of 11 human-induced factors, a natural factor, and temperature, which is one of the risk factors that determine the conditions for the occurrence of forest fires6. Moreover, k-means clustering algorithm, which is an artificial intelligence method, was employed in preparation of the fire risk zone map7. Turkey was selected as the study area because there are social and economic variations among its regions8. Thus, the regional forest directorates in Turkey were separated into four clusters as extreme-risk zone, high-risk zone, moderate-risk zone, and low-risk zone9. Also, a map presenting these risk zones were provided10. The map reveals that, in general, the western and southwestern coastal areas of Turkey are at high risk of forest fires11. On the other hand, the fire risk is relatively low in the northern, central, and eastern areas.},issn = {1614-7499}, doi = {10.1007/s11356-022-22515-w}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22515-w} }

ABSTRACT = {Wildfires influence the global carbon cycle, and the regularity of wildfires is mostly determined by elements such as meteorological conditions, combustible material states, and human activities. The time series and spatial dispersion of wildfires have been studied by some scholars. Wildfire samples were acquired in a monthly series for the Montesinho Natural Park historical fire site dataset (January 2000 to December 2003), which can be used to assess the possible effects of geographical and temporal variations on forest fires. Based on the above dataset, dynamic wildfire distribution thresholds were examined using a K-means++ clustering technique for each subgroup, and monthly series data were categorized as flammable or non-flammable depending on the thresholds. A five-fold hierarchical cross-validation strategy was used to train four machine learning models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). Finally, to explore the performance of those we have mentioned, we used accuracy (ACC), F1 score (F1), and the values for the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). The results depicted that the XGBoost model works best under the evaluation of the three metrics (ACC = 0.8132, F1 = 0.7862, and AUC = 0.8052). The model performance is significantly improved when compared to the approach of classifying wildfires by burned area size (ACC = 72.3%), demonstrating that spatiotemporal heterogeneity has a broad influence on wildfire occurrence. The law of a spatiotemporal distribution connection in wildfires could aid in the prediction and management of wildfires and fire disasters.},

  abstract={The impacts and threats posed by wildfires are dramatically increasing due to climate change. In recent years, the wildfire community has attempted to estimate wildfire occurrence with machine learning models. However, to fully exploit the potential of these models, it is of paramount importance to make their predictions interpretable and intelligible. This study is a first attempt to provide an eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for estimating wildfire occurrence using a Random Forest model with Shapley values for interpretation. Our findings accurately detected regions with a high presence of wildfires (area under the curve 81.3%) and outlined the drivers empowering occurrence, such as the Fire Weather Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of anomalous hotspots. In contexts where human and natural spheres constantly intermingle and interact, the XAI framework, suitably integrated into decision support systems, could support forest managers to prevent and mitigate future wildfire disasters and develop strategies for effective fire management, response, recovery, and resilience.}

To control fire and reach the forest area in time is not always possible. Consequently, the level of destruction is often high. Therefore, predicting fires well in time and taking immediate action is of utmost importance. However, traditional fire prediction approaches often fail to detect fire in time. Therefore, a more reliable approach like the Internet of Things (IoT) needs to be adopted. IoT sensors can not only observe the real-time conditions of an area, but it can also predict fire when combined with Machine learning. This paper provides an insight into the use of Machine Learning models towards the occurrence of forest fires. In this context, eight Machine Learning algorithms: Boosted Decision Trees, Decision Forest Classifier, Decision Jungle Classifier, Averaged Perceptron, 2-Class Bayes Point Machine, Local Deep Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression and Binary Neural Network model have been implemented. Results suggest that the Boosted decision tree model with the Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.78 is the most suitable candidate for a fire prediction model. Based on the results, we propose a novel IoT-based smart Fire prediction system that would consider both meteorological data and images for early fire prediction.}}

ABSTRACT = {Forest fire is one of the foremost environmental disasters that threatens the Australian community. Recognition of the occurrence patterns of fires and the identification of fire risk is beneficial to mitigate probable fire threats. Machine learning techniques are recognized as well-known approaches to solving non-linearity problems such as forest fire risk. However, assessing such environmental multivariate disasters has always been challenging as modelling may be biased from multiple uncertainty sources such as the quality and quantity of input parameters, training processes, and a default setup for hyper-parameters. In this study, we propose a spatial framework to quantify the forest fire risk in the Northern Beaches area of Sydney. Thirty-six significant key indicators contributing to forest fire risk were selected and spatially mapped from different contexts such as topography, morphology, climate, human-induced, social, and physical perspectives as input to our model. Optimized deep neural networks were developed to maximize the capability of the multilayer perceptron for forest fire susceptibility assessment. The results show high precision of developed model against accuracy assessment metrics of ROC = 95.1%, PRC = 93.8%, and k coefficient = 94.3%. The proposed framework follows a stepwise procedure to run multiple scenarios to calculate the probability of forest risk with new input contributing parameters. This model improves adaptability and decision-making as it can be adapted to different regions of Australia with a minor localization adoption requirement of the weighting procedure.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest fires are important factors that influence and restrict the development of forest ecosystems. In this paper, forest-fire-risk prediction was studied based on random forest (RF) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. The Heihe area of Heilongjiang Province is one of the key forest areas and forest-fire-prone areas in China. Based on daily historical forest-fire data from 1995 to 2015, daily meteorological data, topographic data and basic geographic information data, the main forest-fire driving factors were first analyzed by using RF importance characteristic evaluation and logistic stepwise regression. Then, the prediction models were established by using the two machine learning methods. Furthermore, the goodness of fit of the models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic test method. Finally, the fire-risk grades were divided by applying the kriging method. The results showed that 11 driving factors were significantly correlated with forest-fire occurrence, and days after the last rain, daily average relative humidity, daily maximum temperature, daily average water vapor pressure, daily minimum relative humidity and distance to settlement had a high correlation with the risk of forest-fire occurrence. The prediction accuracy of the two algorithms in regard to fire points was higher than that for nonfire points. The overall prediction accuracy and goodness of fit of the RF and BPNN algorithms were similar. The two methods were both suitable for forest-fire occurrence prediction. The high-fire-risk zones were mainly concentrated in the northwestern and central parts of the Heihe area.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of the present review is to analyze and evaluate the most used and well-performing environmental forest fire danger rating systems and indices globally, aiming to the creation of an integrated forest fire danger system for Greece. The analysis emphasizes the core input parameters that have been associated with forest fire danger (i.e., weather, vegetation, topography, and hydrology) and the computational procedure of each system index as well as the categorization of the output values. Online search engines such as Scopus, Google Scholar, WorldWideScience, ScienceDirect, and ResearchGate were used in the search for relevant literature published in scientific journals, manuals, and reports. The retrieved studies were classified and reviewed. Studies were selected for analytically describing the calculation process related to forest fire danger ignition and not being strictly geographically bound. A total of 210 studies were included in the current review, describing 63 forest fire danger systems and indices. These were analyzed and evaluated based on a scoring system. Overall, the top-rated indices were the: Nesterov&rsquo;s index, Sharples&rsquo; index, Keetch and Byram&rsquo;s drought index, Telicyn logarithmic, and vapor pressure deficit, and the 3rd and the 4th also proved to be the most accurate for fire-prone regions. Remote sensing indices also proved to be promising in forest fire danger estimation.},

abstract = {Annually, millions of hectares of forest lands around the world are destroyed by fires. To minimize the fire-caused losses, more studies on the risk prediction of forest fires need to be carried out. For predicting the risk of forest fires in cloud-rich areas (e.g., the southwest of China), the synergetic use of operational forecasting systems and remote sensing-based models is expected to have a consistent performance. Therefore, we proposed in this study a new model based on ant-miner algorithm which has a good capability of solving multivariable and non-linear problems in the synergetic modeling of multi-source data. Based on historical fire data during 2000–2018 in Chongqing city, its performance was tested, and then was compared with that of other three models (i.e., meteorological data-, Artificial Neural Network-, and Support Vector Machine-based models). Results showed that, without interference from human factors, the risk predictions of proposed model were more objective. And, its mined-rules were easier to understand and also portable across multiple GIS platforms. Moreover, the proposed model has a better performance at predicting risk levels (i.e., overall accuracy was 79.02% and Kappa coefficient was 0.678) and the spatial distribution of its predictions were more detailed. This research indicated that the ant-miner algorithm-based model was more effective and reliable, and it could be used for constructing the operational system of risk predictions for forest fires in cloud-rich areas.}

abstract = {This study assesses forest-fire susceptibility (FFS) in Fars Province, Iran using three geographic information system (GIS)-based machine-learning algorithms: boosted regression tree (BRT), general linear model (GLM), and mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). Recently, BRT, GLM, and MDA have become important machine-learning algorithms and their use has been enriched by application to various fields of research. A database of historical FFs identified using Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS satellite images (at 358 locations) and ten influencing factors (elevation, slope, topographical wetness index, aspect, distance from urban areas, annual mean temperature, land use, distance from road, annual mean rainfall, and distance from river) were input into a GIS. The 358 sites were divided into two sets for training (70%) and validation (30%). BRT, GLM, and MDA models were used to analyze the spatial relationships between the factors influencing FFs and the locations of fires to generate an FFS map. The prediction success of each modelled FFS map was determined with the help of the ROC curve, accuracy, overall accuracy, True-skill statistic (TSS), F-measures, corrected classify instances (CCI), and K-fold cross-validation (4-fold). The accuracy results of training and validation dataset in the BRT (AUC=88.90% and 88.2%) and MDA (AUC=86.4% and 85.6%) models are more effective than the GLM (AUC=86.6% and 82.5%) model. Also, the outcome of the 4-fold measure confirmed the results from the other accuracy measures. Therefore, the accuracies of the BRT and MDA models are satisfactory and are suitable for FFS mapping in Fars Province. Finally, the well-accepted neural network application of learning-vector quantization (LVQ) reveals that land use, annual mean rainfall, and slope angle were the most useful determinants of FFS. The resulting FFS maps can enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of forest resources and ecological balances in this province.}

In this paper, a fuzzy inference and big data analysis algorithm is proposed to assess fire risk and calculated the quantitative potential fire risk. These factors converted to triangular fuzzy numbers are calculated by fuzzification and output fire rating level. The continuous 24-hour weather information, which can reflect the high accurate status of forest environment, is collected by the rechargeable wireless sensor network. The fuzzy reasoning system was evaluated for Nanjing City region, the capital of Jiangsu Province, China. The high possibility of potential forest fires risk can be measured by this algorithm, therefore we need to pay more attention to prevent forest fire condition.}

This chapter presents various design methods as well as an overview of the simulation techniques and programs suitable for solar heating and cooling systems. A brief review of artificial intelligence methods and their applications in solar energy systems is also presented. The design methods presented include the f-chart, utilizability Φ, and the Φ¯, f-chart method. The f-chart is based on the correlation of the results of a large number of simulations in terms of easily calculated dimensionless variables. The utilizability method is used in cases where the collector operating temperature is known or can be estimated and for which critical radiation levels can be established. The utilizability method is based on the analysis of hourly weather data to obtain the fraction of the total month's radiation that is above a critical level. The Φ¯, f-chart method is a combination of the utilizability and f-chart methods, applied in systems where the energy supplied to a load is above a minimum useful temperature and the temperature of this energy supply has no effect on the performance of the load system as long as it is greater than the minimum temperature.}

This study aims at introduce a new machine learning method, named as DFP-MnBpAnn, based on Artificial Neural Network (Ann) with a novel hybrid training algorithm of Differential Flower Pollination (DFP) and mini-match backpropagation (MnBp) for spatial modeling of forest fire danger. Tropical forest of the Lam Dong province (Vietnam) was used as case study. To achieve this task, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database of the forest fire for the study area was established. Accordingly, DFP, as a metaheuristic method, is used to optimize the weights and structure of Ann to fit the GIS database at hand. Whereas, MnBp is employed periodically during the DFP-based optimization process, in which MnBp acts as a local search aiming to accelerate both the quality of the found solutions and the convergence rate. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed DFP-MnBpAnn model is superior to other benchmark methods with satisfactory prediction accuracy (Classification Accuracy Rate=88.43%). This fact confirms that DFP-MnBpAnn is a promising alternative for the problem of large-scale forest fire danger mapping.}

Based on the forest meteorological fire risk data, a forest fire risk prediction model with regional characteristics and self-learning characteristics is constructed to solve the problems of low compatibility of the existing machine learning methods with binary unbalanced forest fire data, improve the accuracy of forest fire prediction and provide decision-making basis for forestry risk management. The comparative analysis results show that the prediction accuracy of the improved framework in different test sets is improved by 13% on average. Compared with the existing machine learning model for forest fire prediction, the prediction accuracy of the framework proposed in this paper is comprehensively better than the existing methods in terms of real forest fire data.}

abstract = {Wildfires, whether natural or caused by humans, are considered among the most dangerous and devastating disasters around the world. Their complexity comes from the fact that they are hard to predict, hard to extinguish and cause enormous financial losses. To address this issue, many research efforts have been conducted in order to monitor, predict and prevent wildfires using several Artificial Intelligence techniques and strategies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Remote Sensing. The latter offers a rich source of satellite images, from which we can retrieve a huge amount of data that can be used to monitor wildfires. The method used in this paper combines Big Data, Remote Sensing and Data Mining algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and SVM) to process data collected from satellite images over large areas and extract insights from them to predict the occurrence of wildfires and avoid such disasters. For this reason, we implemented a methodology that serves this purpose by building a dataset based on Remote Sensing data related to the state of the crops (NDVI), meteorological conditions (LST), as well as the fire indicator “Thermal Anomalies”, these data, were acquired from “MODIS” (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), a key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. This dataset is available on GitHub via this link (https://github.com/ouladsayadyounes/Wildfires). Experiments were made using the big data platform “Databricks”. Experimental results gave high prediction accuracy (98.32%). These results were assessed using several validation strategies (e.g., classification metrics, cross-validation, and regularization) as well as a comparison with some wildfire early warning systems.}

Its implementation was carried out using the created information system (IS) for predicting the consequences of emergency situations, which is based on a single information space of the territory of the subject of the Russian Federation. The paper proposes an approach to creating an IS based on a distributed, peer-to-peer architecture when information resources (in relation to the considered IS) are not only presented as data, but also as various applications of basic ISs. A geographical information system is used as a basic one for solving problems of forecasting development and consequences of emergency situations. The decision support subsystem meets the following requirements: provides forecasts of occurrence and development of emergency situations in the form of predictive bulletins for review and approval of the management; provides paperwork for submission to rapid response services. Calculation of consequences of emergency situations is based on the following methods: assessment of consequences of accidents at explosive and fire-hazardous objects; forecasting and assessment of medical consequences of accidents at explosive and fire-hazardous objects; predicting the extent of contamination with highly toxic substances in accidents (destruction) at hazardous chemical facilities and transport; predicting possible accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters; assessing damage from man-made, natural and terrorist emergencies, as well as classifying and recording them.}

Understanding the common and variable features of data aggregation processes, especially their implications to the time-related properties, is key to improving the quality of the designed system and reduce design effort. In this paper, we present a survey of data aggregation processes in a variety of application domains from literature. We investigate their common and variable features, which serves as the basis of our previously proposed taxonomy called DAGGTAX. By studying the implications of the DAGGTAX features, we formulate a set of constraints to be satisfied during design, which helps to check the correctness of the specifications and reduce the design space. We also provide a set of design heuristics that could help designers to decide the appropriate mechanisms for achieving the selected features. We apply DAGGTAX on industrial case studies, showing that DAGGTAX not only strengthens the understanding, but also serves as the foundation of a design tool which facilitates the model-driven design of data aggregation processes.},

    abstract = {In the recent era of the Internet of Things, the dominant role of sensors and the Internet provides a solution to a wide variety of real-life problems. Such applications include smart city, smart healthcare systems, smart building, smart transport and smart environment. However, the real-time IoT sensor data include several challenges, such as a deluge of unclean sensor data and a high resource-consumption cost. As such, this paper addresses how to process IoT sensor data, fusion with other data sources, and analyses to produce knowledgeable insight into hidden data patterns for rapid decision-making. This paper addresses the data processing techniques such as data denoising, data outlier detection, missing data imputation and data aggregation. Further, it elaborates on the necessity of data fusion and various data fusion methods such as direct fusion, associated feature extraction, and identity declaration data fusion. This paper also aims to address data analysis integration with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing, towards various challenges in IoT sensor network and sensor data analysis. In summary, this paper is the first of its kind to present a complete overview of IoT sensor data processing, fusion and analysis techniques.},

abstract = {Data fusion is the joint analysis of multiple inter-related datasets that provide complementary views of the same phenomenon. The process of correlating and fusing information from multiple sources generally allows more accurate inferences than those that the analysis of a single dataset can yield. Data fusion is a multifaceted concept with clear advantages but at the same time with numerous challenges that need to be carefully addressed. Coupled tensor decompositions have been proved successful in a plethora of data fusion applications, in view of their uniqueness properties and their unique ability to discover and fuse latent multidimensional information from inter-linked datasets. The aim of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the data fusion concept and its advantages and challenges, with a discussion of coupled tensor decomposition models and methods, showing their power in solving data fusion tasks, as compared to matrix decomposition-based approaches. A few relevant applications are overviewed, particularly the fusion of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging data.}

	abstract = {Forest fires severity has increased in Portugal in the last decades. Climate change scenarios suggest the reinforcement of this severity. Forest ecosystem managers and policy-makers thus face the challenge of developing effective fire prevention policies. The characterization of forest fires is instrumental for meeting this challenge. An approach for characterizing fire occurrence in Portugal, combining the use of geographic information systems and statistical analysis techniques, is presented. Emphasis was on the relationships between ecological and socioeconomic features and fire occurrence. The number and sizes of wildfires in Portugal were assessed for three 5-year periods (1987--1991, 1990--1994, and 2000--2004). Features maps were overlaid with perimeters of forest fires, and the proportion of burned area for each period was modeled using weighted generalized linear models (WGLM). Descriptive statistics showed variations in the distribution of fire size over recent decades, with a significant increase in the number of very large fires. Modeling underlined the impact of the forest cover type on the proportion of area burned. The statistical analysis further showed that socioeconomic features such as the proximity to roads impact the probability of fires occurrence. Results suggest that this approach may provide insight needed to develop fire prevention policies.}
