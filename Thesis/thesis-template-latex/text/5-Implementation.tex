\section{Study Area}
The study area encompasses the geographic mainland region of Portugal, extending 89,000 km\textsuperscript{2} located between latitude 42.3°N to 36.7°N and longitude 9.8°W to 6.0°W. Portugal experiences a Mediterranean climate influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and characterized by a mostly wet and cool season followed by a dry summer \cite{Mora2020, portugalClimate01, Marques2011}.

Altitudes range from sea level to  2000 metres, and higher elevations are more prevelent central and northern regions \cite{Marques2011}.

The northern region is characterised by lower temperatures and higher values of precipitation than the southern region \cite{Marques2011}. The average annual temperature ranges from 7 to 18°C, while the annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 2,800 mm.

Portugal's vegetation is a blend of Atlantic, European, Mediterranean, and African species \cite{britannica_portugal_climate}, and four tree species account for 80\% of all the forest area:\textit{Pinus pinaster}, \textit{Eucalyptus globulus}, \textit{Quercus suber}, and \textit{Quercus rotundifolia} \cite{Marques2011}.





\section{Dataset Sources}

\subsection{Wildfire Occurrences}
Historical records of fire occurrences were taken from \cite{centraldedados_incendios_website, centraldedados_incendios} and \cite{icnf2024}. The records featured in \cite{centraldedados_incendios_website, centraldedados_incendios} span across 35 years, from 1980 to 2015, and hold 791453 instances of wildfires. Its most relevant features are encapsulated in table \ref{historical_occurrences_1980_2015}, and table \ref{number_occurrences_1980_2013} holds the fire records for each year.


The records from \cite{icnf2024} span across 10 years, from 2013 to 2023, and were retrieved with an API \href{https://fogos.icnf.pt/localizador/webserviceocorrencias.asp?ano=YEAR}{endpoint}. It features 140514 entries, and its most important fields are described in table \ref{number_occurrences_1980_2013}, while table \ref{number_occurrences_2013_2023} holds the number of occurrences individually by year.

\subsection{Weather Variables}
Historical Weather Variables were taken from the api \cite{Zippenfenig_Open-Meteo}. This encompasses both daily and hourly weather data retrieval from all around the world. The API matches the sent location with multiple reanalysis datasets and yields the best optimal result based on location. It has a complete record of historical weather conditions by combining observations from weather stations, aeroplanes, buoys, radar, and satellites, and gaps in data are filled using mathematical models to estimate the values of different weather variables \cite{Zippenfenig_Open-Meteo}.

\cite{Zippenfenig_Open-Meteo} datasets are featured in table X.

\subsection{Fire danger indices historical data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service \cite{CopernicusCDS2019}}
The dataset "Fire danger indices historical data from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service" \cite{CopernicusCDS2019} provided by ECMWF, contains full historical reconstruction of weather conditions suitable for the origin, spread, and sustainability of natural occurring fires. 

It embodies fire danger indices from three distinct models created in Canada, United States and Australia. The fire danger indices are obtained from historical simulations and weather forecast provided by the dataset ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. 

The available data starts from January 1940 and it extends all the way through 2023, but the data records are regularly extended with time as ERA5 forcing data becomes available. The variables contained in the dataset are expressed in the table \ref{copernicus_danger_indices}.

\section{Additional sources of Data}
The python library geopy \cite{geopy} was used to geolocate multiple locations, resolving district, parish, municipalities, and localities to sets of coordinates. Geopy utilises multiple geocoding web services like OpenStreetMap Nominatim and Google Geocoding API to resolve locations. 


The Google Maps service \cite{googlexmaps} was used to manually check if the extracted data from Open-Meteo corresponded to the intended location. It was also used to analyse some errors that were found in the location of some entries.




\section{Creating the dataset}
The dataset described in \ref{historical_sites_no_coords} is composed of multiple files describing historical occurrences since 1980 until 2015. Prior to 2001, the fields from each file became unstandardized, and there's no explicit parameter mentioning a natural wildfire cause. Therefore, the time frame considered was from 2001 to 2012. The latter years were rejected due to the fact that entries from \ref{historical_sites_no_coords} do not contain any explicit latitude and longitude. They rely on territorial entities such as districts, municipalities, parishes, and NUTS to describe locations.

The second historical wildfire dataset \ref{dataset_icnf2013_2023} is also composed of multiple files. Its time frame is from 2013 until 2023. Unlike dataset \ref{historical_sites_no_coords}, entries do contain an explicit latitude and longitude values. It also features descriptive territorial entities. 


\subsection{Entry selection}
Entries whose cause was deliberate or negligent fire were excluded. The fire causes contained, by order of importance, in the dataset are: natural, reignition, unknown, and undefined.
Entries that were undefined as causes differed from those with unknown causes because their cause field was blank, and entries that had unknown causes were explicitly described as unknown.

\subsection{Geocoding places from 2001 to 2012 historical wildfire locations}
\label{geocoding_historical}
The dataset entries featured in \ref{historical_sites_no_coords} contain no direct field leading up to the real site location coordinates. To tackle this issue, an algorithm with the help of the geopy library \cite{geopy} was made to resolve the names of historial wildfire places to a set of coordinates.


Using multiple combinations, attempts were made to geocode the location, featuring the combinations in the table \ref{geocoding_entries_2001_2012}. The district, municipality, parish, and local (if available) of each entry were utilized for this purpose. Sometimes, the name of the exact wildfire locality was enclosed in brackets, requiring processing using strings to extract it.



\begin{table}[h!]
	\caption{Combinations for local geocoding}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


These combinations caused errors in the location of some entries because the geocoders returned coordinates in other countries, such as Spain and Brazil, due to similar names in some locations. The entries that produced errors underwent recalculation, with the addition of "Portugal" at the end. An example of this usage is  {\it Parish, District, Portugal}.

After each entry was resolved, their latitude and longitude were added as values in the columns LAT and LON of each corresponding file.


A very minor sample of entries couldn't be geocoded using this method. Therefore they were manually geocoded from the Google Maps service. 



\subsection{Retrieving historical meteorological data}
In order to retrieve historical meteorological data, a Python script was made. It went through each historical fire location and downloaded weather data about the entire day regarding the wildfire. The weather data contained all the fields described in \ref{open_meteo}. 



\subsection{Linking historical wildfires with historical weather data}
Dizer número de instâncias
Every unit from each field was specified in the retrieved data, so it had to be removed.
Dizer que NA ficou com NC no dataset.




\subsection{Matching each historical wildfire with tree species}
\label{tree_species_wildfires}


O que mudei no dataset inicial das trees
dfTreesDRP['stateProvince'] = dfTreesDRP['stateProvince'].replace('Bragança District', 'Bragança')
dfTreesDRP['locality'] = dfTreesDRP['locality'].replace('Ovadas e Panchora', 'Ovadas e Panchorra')
Continha um erro, Ovadas e Panchora não existe.


variáveis das trees que foram usadas: scientificName,locality,stateProvince,occurrenceStatus,individualCount,decimalLatitude,decimalLongitude,coordinateUncertaintyInMeters,coordinatePrecision,elevation,elevationAccuracy,depth,depthAccuracy


haversine formula da distncia \cite{esri2024}.


Multiple tests were made for distance, 120metres, 500 metres.

Especies que estavam na mesma freguesia ou concelho foram associadas sem fazer cálculo de distancia. Para combater espécies duplicadas, só se adicionava uma espécie se esta não estivesse contida na entrada do fogo.
Distrito, usava-se uma distância de 1000 metros.

As restantes entradas que não obtiveram correspondencia com os outros métodos anteriores, foi feita uma análise das espécies que estavam mais perto, neste passo foram detetados erro, alguns valores tabulados do icnf não correspondiam à realidade, e alguns valores em \ref{geocoding_historical} foram mal calculados.

Devido ao tamanho do dataset das arvores o script de python utilizado dividiu os anos em chunks e com multiprocessamento foi calculado as especies de arvores perto do fogo.


\subsection{Locations in the middle of the sea.}
Between 2013 and 2023, some of the featured locations were in the middle of the ocean. Although having a real-life location set explicitly in the file when using services like Google Maps, its coordinates were undeniably wrong. These multiple geolocation errors were discovered when trying to pin multiple species of trees \ref{tree_species_wildfires} to a single location with a distance function calculator. The algorithm yielded values that were outside of the range spectrum of 1500km. Leading to the manual confirmation of these errors with the help of the Google Maps service.
