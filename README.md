The 6th National Forest Inventory was published by ICNF - Instituto de Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas and uses aerial and ground survey data collected in 2015 for the evaluation and monitoring of the portuguese forest resources.
Study area

The geographic area considered for the original study was Portugal Mainland.
Funding

The    6th National Forest Inventory was co-funded by the Portuguese Carbon Fund (FPC - Fundo Português de Carbono), by ICNF, I.P. and the European Union, through the Environment Operational Programme (application 1.1/00021– Documentos Estruturantes da Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade). The preparation of this resource for publication through GBIF was supported by Project PORBIOTA―Portuguese E-Infrastructure for Information and Research on Biodiversity (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-022127), under the Operational Thematic Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization (POCI), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) and FCT.
